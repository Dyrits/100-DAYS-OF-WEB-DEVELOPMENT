      <h2>Why JavaScript?</h2>
      <p>
        JavaScript is a programming language which can be executed by the
        browser, after the page was loaded.
      </p>
      <p>
        With JavaScript, you, as a developer, can access, read and manipulate
        the parsed HTML code ("the DOM") to add additional behavior and features
        to the page.
      </p>
      <p>For example, you can make the below button remove this text!</p>
      <button>Remove Paragraph</button>
      <p>
        Or take the next button: It adds a blue background to the first
        paragraph.
      </p>
      <button id="add-background-color">Add Blue Background Color</button>
